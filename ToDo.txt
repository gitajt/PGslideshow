# ToDo:
#       write config/state file & check for changes on startup
#       (could assist with portability...)
#
#       Determine resolution numbers dynamically cf. pygame.display.info
#
#
#       Enumerate subdirectories. Cycle through them from the Menu screen.
#
#       Navigate thumbnail view with cursor keys. Draw a cursor under the selected image.
#       1 - Winner / 2 - Runner-up / etc; copy file to Results subdirectory with suitable filename
#
#       Use a list of file hashes to look up the submitters?
#
#       Could even add an 'add entry' menu item to browse jpgs and copy to
#       the appropriate directory, entering entrant name at the same time.
#
#       12) Finish scoping the project :-)
